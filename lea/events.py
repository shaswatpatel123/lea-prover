"""The agent event contract — the event-out half of config-in / event-out.

`run_events()` (in agent.py) yields these immutable events instead of printing.
Three consumers share this one contract: the CLI renderer (render.py) reproduces
today's stdout from them, a UI can render them live, and eval can collect them.
